# SCR_glossary

This document is intended to help anyone who is just starting to work with Spatial Capture Recapture models. Some terms are unique for these models, and I find very helpful to have the most used terms in one place so I can be able to review them quickly. 

I provide tables, matrices, and graphs where necessary. 

**If you would like me to add, expand or fix a term, please post an issue and I will get back to you.**

Additionally, I list the references I used to define these terms. Some terms are a combinaiton of various references. 

My idea is to have this glossary translated to other languages to help scientists and students around the world better understand SCR models. I will start with English, and then Spanish (the two languages I know). If you'd like to contribute to translations of this glossary, either send me an email (gabriella.palomo at gmail dot com) or post an issue in this repository.
