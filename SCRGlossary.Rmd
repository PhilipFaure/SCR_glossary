### Glossary of most common used terms in Spatial Capture Recapture (SCR) models 

##### I include in [*] the context in which the term is most used. If a term has a synonym I include it at the end of the definition using Syn. 

1. **Abundance [Ecology]:** total number of individuals in an area at a given time. 

1. **Abundance [SCR]:** total number of activity centers in an area at a given time.

1. **Activity center:** is the centroid of the space that an individual occupies or uses during the period in which traps are active. Syn. Home range center.

1. **Connectivity:** The degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes movement among locations. 

1. **Density [in ecology]:** number of individuals per area at a given time. 

1. **Density [in SCR]:** number of activity centers per area at a given time. 

1. **Detection probability:** used mostly in SCR context. Syn. encounter probability. 

1. **Ecological distance:** the least cost path between two points estimated from encounter history data. 

1. **Encounter probability:** used mostly in occupancy context. Syn. detection probability. 

1. **Euclidean distance:** the straight-line distance between two points. 

1. **Home range:** defined in SCR as the area used by an organism during some time period.

1. **Homogeneous point process (HPP):** a spatial point process that has a constant intensity parameter. In SCR the constant intensity parameter is expected density. 

1. **Inhomogeneous point process (IPP):** a spatial point process for which the intensity parameter is location specific (spatially varying). The intensity parameter is density. 

1. **Latent variable:** a variable not directly observed, but inferred from data. E.g., activity center. 

1. **Occasion:** a unique and independent site survey. 

1. **Occupancy:** the proportion of sites occupied by a target species. Occupy means that at least one individual is present at the site. 

1. **Session:** a stratum defining meaningful grouping for purposes of data collection. Usually a session is defined by a site, a year, or a combination of both. 

1. **Site:** 

1. **Spatial capture recapture (SCR):** a hierarchical capture-recapture (CR) model. An extension  of CR to make use of encounter location data to study spatial aspects of animal populations. These models can be used for spatial models of density, resource selection, transience/dispersal. SCR models describe the probability of encounter in a trap, conditional on where an individual (i) lives (Si). The biological process in SCR models is how individual sare distributed in space. Ecologists can use SCR models to address questions regarding: 1) spatial patterns in density, 2) resource selection or space usage, 3) dispersal, transience, and 4) landscape/connectivity. SCR models are basically a unified framework to draw inferences about density and spatial population processes. 

1. **Spatial encounter history [SCR] (yijk):** the spatially explicity observation data matrix representing which individual (i) was encountered when (k) and where (j). Yijk = individual i was detected (y=1) or not (y=0) at trap j in sampling occasion k. 

1. **State space (S):** an area containing all plausible activity centers of individuals observed during a study. It could be a discrete or continuous area containing all plausible activity centers of the detected individuals. Syn. Area of integration. 

1. **Trap:** the spatial unit at which individuals are observed. The location of an observation si the centroid of the pixel within which the observation was made. Syn. locator.
